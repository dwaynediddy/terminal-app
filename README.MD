## R5 Development plan

- describe at a high level what the application will do
The application will use ruby gem colorise to implement and draw attention to key elements of the app. 
Using the require method to store classes for characters and items in the app means that if needed to or wanted to code can easily be pulled and unique applications can be made. While the “gets” from users will aim to work seamlessly with the random number generator invoked in the app for different experiences for the user with consistently different outcomes. The application run through a process introducing itself to the user and asking for input randomly generated inscription will work with data being stored in hashes and classes with a diamond like line with complex code involving hashes within hashes, Having multiple uses in multiple classes so the consistency with user and character interaction remains consistent running in a loop for turns with random outcomes and little predictability. Errors will be handled with a warning and a loop for a player to be able to correct the insufficient  input when necessary.

- identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
encountering problems may come up if the players input is not sufficient data to run the program ie putting in non numeric characters or floats into a gets that requires an integer solving this problem will be running an error message advising the user on what needs to be placed in the gets for the code to pass on to the next action, repeating itself until the option is amicably complete to satisfaction of the program. the user will solve the problem of needing to pick within a range of numbers the random NPC will accept. While a price too high the npc will leave, thus leaving the player scoreless for this round. A price too low will either give the user no score or a low score so realising what it possibly to be too high or too low will affect the final score.
The reason for the app development is a basic understanding of user interaction with Non player characters(NPC) and getting measurement of a barter system to aim avoid greed and succumb to recent values that can benefit both parties.

- identify the target audience
this application will be targeting young students interested in business or a nostalgic person from the 70s when terminal apps where relevant and at there peak, while a simple game lessons are to be learned about the handling of business situations and promote growth to potentially making an unsatisfactory decision and conceivably reconsidering when put in a similar situation. 

the target user will simply use this inputting names and numbers for the complex algorithm to work out if the transaction will be successful

## R6

Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature

Due to this app needing variables to be called by seperate values the module has become a staple in this terminal app. While the modest number of variables in the hashes being only 3 for the NPC and 3 for the items through out the loop they are called upon for different reasons. storing hashes in different folders and using the require_relative function this has given the potential for the game to be further developed easily.

Aiming to use the most narrow scope the local variable has been used when applicable due to the wide usage of the values used between the methods a lot of access is needed between methods making the instance variable is quite dominant in the code 

--Will write about error testing after I have done it—


## R7

Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.
Your outline must include:
- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user

for the user to figure out how to play there will be an instruction folder in the git repository with information regarding how the game is played what is needed and used. Including an aim instructions and brief run-through of the game and interactions to expect with NPC

**Error handling will be dealt with by the user receiving a message and instructions of what needs to take place before they can move on to the next phase and then return them to the original stage where the input was miss used.**

## R9
Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan

> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.
